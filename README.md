Gaussian Interaction profile (GIP based RLS prediction)
This code is created based on the paper (http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/21/3036.long)define a
kernel on these profiles, called the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel,                           
and use a simple classifier, (kernel) Regularized Least Squares (RLS),for prediction drugâ€“target interactions.
